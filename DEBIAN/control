Description: Portmap - A powerful tool for managing port assignments
 Portmap is a lightweight command-line utility designed to simplify
 port management for developers and administrators. It allows users
 to add, delete, search, and export port assignments with ease.

 Key features:
  - JSON export for seamless integration with other tools.
  - Automatic backups to ensure data safety.
  - Validation of input to avoid conflicts or errors.
  - Search functionality to quickly find port information.

 Portmap is ideal for managing ports in complex environments,
 such as Docker-based workflows or networked applications.
 Examples include adding a port with metadata, exporting the database
 to JSON, or creating regular backups for disaster recovery.
